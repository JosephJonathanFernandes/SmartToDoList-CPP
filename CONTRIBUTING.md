# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is a small learning repo; please follow these guidelines:

- Keep changes focused and minimal.
- Open a draft PR for larger design changes so maintainers can provide feedback.
- Don't commit secrets; use environment variables and update `.gitignore` as needed.
- Run formatting and tests before opening a PR.
