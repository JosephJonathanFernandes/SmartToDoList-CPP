# Learning Notes

This repository is intended as a learning exercise. Changes made include:

- Refactoring a single-file program to a modular CMake project.
- Replacing manual array-based heap with `std::vector` + heap algorithms.
- Adding basic unit tests and CI configuration.

Next learning steps:
- Add more unit tests covering file IO and date parsing edge cases.
- Integrate static analyzers and formatters (clang-tidy, clang-format).
- Add packaging and cross-platform instructions.
